Game Design Document, or at least what this document is trying to be

Idea: OSU, but instead of clicking buttons with mouse, we press them on the keyboard

Buttons will appear on the screen with random letters, that need to be pressed.

There will be an outline around the button that will move towards its center. You need to press the button before the outline connects with button's border.
